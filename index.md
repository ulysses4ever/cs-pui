In 2017, I [wrote an article about finding academic happiness with **primarily-undergraduate institutions**](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) because of the compelling balance they offer between teaching and research. I continue to receive emails with the same  question: _how do I find these jobs?_ This listing of ads is meant to help navigate that muddy water. [See archived listings from previous years](faq#archive).

This document does _not_ contain most CS faculty positions. It's specifically intended for people who want to invest in teaching/mentorship with undergraduate students while still staying active in their scholarship. 

{% capture criteria %}
**Criteria:** the positions on this page should be...
- accessible to those with a Ph.D. in CS (or a closely related field)
- permanent positions (mostly likely tenure-track) [_why?_](faq#scope)
- universities that identify as **primarily-undergraduate institutions** [_why?_](faq#scope)
- institutions that highly value teaching, but also _secure time and financial resources for faculty to remain engaged with research_. [_what does this mean?_](faq#research)
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice notice-gray">{{ criteria | markdownify }}</div>

If you are considering entering the job market, I'd encourage you to visit the [**Resources**](resources.html) pages for some insight into the ways in which PUIs might differ in their interviewing processes and values.

## ðŸ“‹ Deadlines and Quick Links (_soonest on top_)

ðŸ’¡ **Deadlines are treated very differently between institutions**. Read carefully. For example, I _strongly_ encourage you to email search chairs if you're interested in positions that appear to have passed - they might still be open!
